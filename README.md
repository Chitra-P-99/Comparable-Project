# Comparator-Project

In Java, the Comparator interface is used to define custom comparison rules for objects, allowing you to sort objects in various ways based on different criteria. Below is a simple project demonstrating the use of the Comparator interface to sort a list of custom objects.

Project Overview:
 create a Java project that defines a Employee class. I will use the Comparator interface to compare Employee objects based on their ages, salary, id and names.  then create a list of Employee objects and sort them using the Employee Comparator class.
